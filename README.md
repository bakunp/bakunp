### Hello! 👋

I am a **Software Developer** with 2 years of commercial experience in **C++**.
I decided to expand my engineering horizons and dive deep into the **C# / .NET** ecosystem. 🚀

🔭 **Purpose of this profile**
I treat this space as a public engineering journal. This repository serves to:
* 📚 **Document** the effort put into development and my learning path.
* 📈 **Monitor** progress (from simple console apps to advanced architecture).
* 🤝 **Share** – ultimately, I aim for projects created here (like *Finance Manager*) to become valuable tools for the open-source community.

🌱 **Currently working on:**
I am developing **Finance Manager** – a project where I apply and master design patterns, Clean Architecture, and best practices within the .NET environment.
